Hello world. My name is Simon and I am an Masters (MS) student in Computational and Applied Mathematics at UCB performing research in Power System Modeling, Dynamics, Stability, Optimization, Control, and Simulation all with a focus of developing a net-zero, smart power grid of the future. This GitHub profile contains uploads of some of my *opensource* work in graduate courses, research, and personal projects. For a quick look into some of my creations, see the README files in each repository (which often contain a written document of thurough explaination of the project) or watch the slideshow below highlighting visuals from the projects.
